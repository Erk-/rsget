To install this you first need cargo and the rust compiler you can get that from: https://rustup.rs/
Then you want to download the latest release from https://gitlab.com/Erk/rsget/-/archive/master/rsget-master.zip and unpack it to a new directonary
you will also need git, which you can get from here https://git-scm.com/ then open a powershell window and execute the following commands from the folder.
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
cd rsget_cli
cargo build --release
#+END_SRC

Then copy the file rsget_cli.exe from the target/release/ directonary to somewhere else.
Then you can use it with rsget_cli (or what you named the file) followed by the url.

It currently works for DouyuTv and PandaTv, with support fro AfreecaTv coming soon

To download afreeca you will need ffmpeg installed as well.

It will be released on github when I have worked a bit more on it.
